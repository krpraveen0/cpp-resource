OOP
-----------
The major prupose of C++ programming was to introduce the concept of object oriented programming style in C language.

Actually Object Oriented programming is a paradigm/model that provides many concepts such as data binding, data abstraction, inheritance,
polymorphism etc.

The programming language where everthing is represented as an object is known as truly object oriented programming.
eg: smalltalk 

What is object?
Any real world entity is identified by an object OOP model.

Formally we can define object as
Any entity that has some state and behaviour is known as an object.
for example:
laptop , table, keyboard, fan, bike etc 
object can be physical as well as logical.

Class :
The blueprint with which we can create an object is called class.
The logical design of an object is called class.
Actually Class is  a template for which objects are created.
It can have fields, methods , constructor etc.

syntax to create a class:
----------------------
class <class-name>{
    state
    methods
    constructor
}
example:
let us create a student class
class Student{
    public:
    //field or data member
    int id;
    float fee;
    String name;
}


How to create an object from a given class

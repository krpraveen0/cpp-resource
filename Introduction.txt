Introduction:
--------------------
how to approach for a solution:
---------------------------------
1.) analyse our problem.
2.) Breakdown the problem in smaller parts.
3.) write down solution on paper.
4.) Verify our solution by testing with the couple of examples.
5.) Start writing the code.

Flow Charts:
Diagrammatic representation of a solution to a given problem
Allow us to break down any process into smaller steps and display them in visually pleasing way.
FlowChart component:
Start-stop(terminator)  compnonent.
Input-output component.(parallelogram shape)
Process (rectangle)
Decision(diamond shape)
Program to add two numbers
Program to print first n numbers.
Find the largest number from a given list of numbers
Check for the prime number

Q. write a program to add two numbers.
--------------------------------------
1. Analysis
    what is requirements.
    what we need 
    no of variables needed.
    is there any initial values 
    should i have to take the values from the user?
    what operation i need to perform
    what need to be displayed.

2. Breaking our problem into smaller part:
add two numbers
1. take first number as an input 
2. take second number as an input 
3. perform operation
4. store the result.
5. display the output

Q. write a program to check whether the input given by the use is even or odd.
1. take first number as an input 
2. take second number as an input 
3. perform operation
4. take decesion
5. store the result.
6. display the output

Q. Print first n numbers given by the user.
1. take first number as an input 
2. take second number as an input 
3. perform operation
4. take decesion
5. store the result.
6. display the output
7. repeat

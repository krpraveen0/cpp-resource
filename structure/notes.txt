what is structure ?
It is used to create a complex data type.
it used to store different heterogeneous values at a time.

In another work we can also tell that structure is user defined data type which 
can be used to store heterogeneous values at a time .
struct Person{
    int id;
    string name;
    string address;
    float salary;
};
